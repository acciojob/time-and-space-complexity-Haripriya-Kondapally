    <h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is one of the fundamental concepts in computer science used to evaluate the efficient algorithms. </p>
		   
		<p>Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold temporary data or final result while the program is in execution. The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called <b>space complexity</b> of the algorithm.
		O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size
